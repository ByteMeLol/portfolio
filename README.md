ByteMeLol — Developer Portfolio

This is a single-file, responsive developer portfolio built with HTML, TailwindCSS (CDN), vanilla JavaScript, and AOS (Animate On Scroll).

Files:
- index.html — Complete portfolio page (open in browser).

How to preview:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser. On Windows you can double-click the file or right-click -> Open with -> Browser.

Optional (local server):
- Use a static file server for better behavior (recommended for some browsers' local file restrictions):
  - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000`
  - Node (http-server): `npx http-server . -p 8000`

Notes:
- The contact form is UI-only (no backend).
- Tailwind and AOS are included via CDN; no build step required.

Customization ideas:
- Replace project placeholders with real screenshots and links.
- Add analytics, SEO meta tags, and a resume PDF download.
- If you'd like a deploy-ready version (Netlify/Vercel), I can scaffold that next.
